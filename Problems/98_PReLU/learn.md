### Understanding the PReLU (Parametric ReLU) Activation Function

The PReLU (Parametric Rectified Linear Unit) is an advanced variant of the ReLU activation function that introduces a learnable parameter for negative inputs. This makes it more flexible than standard ReLU and helps prevent the "dying ReLU" problem.

#### Mathematical Definition

The PReLU function is defined as:

$$
PReLU(x) = \begin{cases}
x & \text{if } x > 0 \\
\alpha x & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Where:
- $x$ is the input value
- $\alpha$ is a learnable parameter (typically initialized to a small value like 0.25)

#### Key Characteristics

1. **Adaptive Slope**: Unlike ReLU which has a zero slope for negative inputs, PReLU learns the optimal negative slope parameter ($\alpha$) during training.

2. **Output Range**: 
   - For $x > 0$: Output equals input ($y = x$)
   - For $x \leq 0$: Output is scaled by $\alpha$ ($y = \alpha x$)

3. **Advantages**:
   - Helps prevent the "dying ReLU" problem
   - More flexible than standard ReLU
   - Can improve model performance through learned parameter
   - Maintains the computational efficiency of ReLU

4. **Special Cases**:
   - When $\alpha = 0$, PReLU becomes ReLU
   - When $\alpha = 1$, PReLU becomes a linear function
   - When $\alpha$ is small (e.g., 0.01), PReLU behaves similarly to Leaky ReLU

PReLU is particularly useful in deep neural networks where the optimal negative slope might vary across different layers or channels.
