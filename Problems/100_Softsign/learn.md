## Understanding the Softsign Activation Function

The Softsign activation function is a smooth, non-linear activation function used in neural networks. It's similar to the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function but with different properties, particularly in its tails which approach their limits more slowly.

### Mathematical Definition

The Softsign function is mathematically defined as:

$$
Softsign(x) = \frac{x}{1 + |x|}
$$

Where:
- $x$ is the input to the function
- $|x|$ represents the absolute value of x

### Characteristics

<ul>
    <li><strong>Output Range:</strong> The output is bounded between -1 and 1, approaching these values asymptotically as x approaches ±∞.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape:</strong> The function has an S-shaped curve, similar to tanh but with a smoother approach to its asymptotes.</li>
    <li><strong>Gradient:</strong> The gradient is smoother and more gradual compared to tanh, which can help prevent vanishing gradient problems in deep networks.</li>
    <li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> The function is symmetric around the origin (0,0).</li>
</ul>

### Key Properties

- **Bounded Output:** Unlike ReLU, Softsign naturally bounds its output between -1 and 1
- **Smoothness:** The function is continuous and differentiable everywhere
- **No Saturation:** The gradients approach zero more slowly than in tanh or sigmoid functions
- **Zero-Centered:** The function crosses through the origin, making it naturally zero-centered

This activation function can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need bounded outputs with more gradual saturation compared to tanh or sigmoid functions.
